```

Goals: 

- Read in spatial data (shapefiles)
- Simplify polygons (st_simplify)
- Add and transform projection (st_transform and st_crs)
- Create several finalized-ish maps in R
- Join spatial data (st_join)
- Find spatial intersections (st_intersect)
- Interactive plots with tmap
- Updating color schemes, base layers, etc.
- Plotting spatial lines
- Creating sf data from lat/lon coordinates
